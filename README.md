# AudioLine
A command line music player built in Node.js

Still in very early beta, if you're seeing this I either sent you the link or you made a wrong turn.

## Installation
Dependencies: Node.js.

Clone the repository, enter the folder and run `npm test`. 

## Usage
This program has a temporary CLI at the moment. Upon running the program run `help` to see possible commands.

### Adding songs
Currently there is no real good way to add songs, you basically have to add the mp3 file to the songs folder and then edit `songs.json`.
